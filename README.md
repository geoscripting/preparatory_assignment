Advanced Geoscripting  - SS 2020  -  Instructor: Christina Ludwig 

# Preparatory Assignment

The purpose of this __preparatory assignment__ is to make sure that everyone is well prepared for the block course in August. Therefore, this __assignment is mandatory__ and has to be __submitted prior to the course until August 6th 2020.__ 

The assignment can be accessed and submitted via [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/XeAN5a_k). 

If you encounter problems which you cannot solve on your own, create a new topic in the [GitHub forum](https://github.com/orgs/geoscripting/teams/advanced-geoscripting-2020/discussions) and describe your problem.  

__Important notes:__ 

* Completing this __assignment is a prerequisite for attending the course!__
* __Submission deadline: 6.8.2020__
* Please make sure to __name the output files exactly as described.__

## Learning goals

After you have completed this assignment you will be able to ...

*  name different best practice methods for scientific computing, 
*  install and configure all required software for the course,
*  use Jupyter notebook to write Python code and
*  use git to track your work progress. 

## 1. Best Practices in Scientific Computing

<img src="./img/phdcomic_final.png" alt="final" width="300px" align="right" />
  
Read the paper by [Wilson et al. (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3886731/) on Best Practices for Scientific Computing and answer the following questions. Write your answer into a text file called _scientific\_programming.txt_.

1. The paper describes several problems scientist face when conducting data analyses. From your experience in performing (GIS) analyses, which of these problems seem familiar to you? Did you face other problems not mentioned in the paper? (~100 words)
2. Which methods described in the paper could help you avoid these problems in the future? (~100 words)
3. One of the recommendations by [Wilson et al. (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3886731/) for scientists is to use a Version Control System (VCS). Briefly explain your own words, what the benefits of VCS are in the context of scientific analyses. (~100 words)

## 2. Install and configure required software

1. Follow the instructions given in the section [Software Setup](./software_setup) to install all required software for the course. 

2. Execute the python file _check\_environment.py_ from within your new Python environment to verify that all required packages have been installed successfully. Using the following command the output of the program will be written into a new text file called _check\_environment\_result.txt_. If you get an error message, try the solve it using the suggested solutions.  

	```
	$ python check_environment.py > check_environment_result.txt
	```

## 3. Using git and Jupyter Notebooks

Now we will use git to track the changes of the new files we have created so far. If you are not familiar with git yet, work through the section [Introduction to git](git/index.rst).

### Clone GitHub repository and track your changes

1. If you haven't done so already, clone the GitHub repository of this assignment on your computer. 

	```
	git clone https://github.com/geoscripting/preparatory_assignment.git
	```
	
2. We have created two files so far. Copy these files into the main folder of the cloned repository. Create a commit for each one of them to add them to your local git repository, e.g.

	```
	git add scientific_programming.txt
	git commit -m "added scientific_programming.txt" 
	```

### Create a new Jupyter notebook

1. Activate the _advgeoscripting_ environment and start a Jupyter Notebook server. 
2. Create a new Jupyter notebook using the Python 3 kernel and name it _preparatory\_assignment.ipynb_. 
3. Import the function ```check_packages()``` from _check\_environment.py_ and execute it in order to check whether the notebook is using the right anaconda environment 'advgeoscripting'. If you get a ```ModuleImportError```, check whether the right kernel is selected (Jupyter Menu: Kernel &rarr; Change kernel).
4. Add the notebook to your git repository by creating a new commit.
5. Within the notebook, write a new function called ```list_sum()```, which calculates the sum of all numbers in a list. e.g. 

	``` python
	>>> numbers = [1,2,3,4]
	>>> numbers_sum = list_sum(numbers)
	>>> print(numbers_sum)
	10
	```

6. Create a new commit containing the changes of the notebook. 

### Synchronise your repository with GitHub

1. Push all your commits to GitHub. 

If you make further edits to your files (e.g. editing your answers to the questions in exercise 1) remember that you can always add these changes to your GitHub repository by creating further commits and pushing them to GitHub. 


### Well done, your ready for the course! :)
